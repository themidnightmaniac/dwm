My personal build of dwm, with the following patches:
urg-border-6.2 always-center attach-aside-6.4 bar-height-6.2 and useless-gap

IF YOU ARE NOT USING WAL OR PYWAL to get the wallpaper colors, delete the #include "/home/USER/.cache/wal/colors-wal-dwm.h" line and uncomment the color schemes. IF YOU ARE USING DMENU change the variables in the commands section for its respective colors.

IF YOU ARE USING WAL OR PYWAL just change the #include line to the right user directory.

Dependencies: 
pywal (or wal)
cozette (font)
nitrogen (for setting the wallpaper)
