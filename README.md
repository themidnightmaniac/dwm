My personal build of dwm, which include the following patches (also available in /patches):
urg-border-6.2 always-center attach-aside-6.4 bar-height-6.2 fullgaps-6.4 bar-padding

If you are not using pywal delete the #include "/home/USER/.cache/wal/colors-wal-dwm.h" line and uncomment the color schemes, and also if you are using dmenu change the variables in the /*commands*/ section for their respective colors.

If you are using pywal just change the #include line to the right user directory.

You need to recompile dwm every time you update the theme, and remember to change the wallpaper on nitrogen as well.

Dependencies: 
pywal terminus nitrogen

I've also added some wallpapers that I like to use with this build. I do not own any of these images.
